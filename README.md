# Mushroom Classification Using AdaBoost

# Business Problem
Mushroom poisoning is a serious public health risk, as some poisonous mushrooms closely resemble edible ones.
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive machine learning model that can identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

Additionally, the project aims to derive general guidelines that people should consider when picking mushrooms, based on important features influencing the prediction.

# Business Objective
1. Accurately classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous
2. Reduce the risk of accidental mushroom poisoning
3. Support safer decision-making using data-driven insights
4. Highlight key features that indicate poisonous mushrooms

# Problem Type
1. **Classification Problem**
2. **Binary Outcome:** Edible / Poisonous

# Solution Approach
1. Data understanding and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding and transformation
3. Model training using AdaBoost Classifier
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
5. Interpretation of important features
6. Translating insights into human-readable safety guidelines

# Key Features Considered
1. Cap shape and color
2. Gill size and color
3. Odor
4. Spore print color
5. Ring type
6. Habitat

These features play a critical role in determining mushroom safety.

# Business Impact
1. Helps prevent health hazards caused by poisonous mushrooms
2. Acts as a decision-support tool, not a replacement for expert knowledge
3. Encourages awareness of high-risk mushroom traits

#  Important Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and awareness purposes only
It should not be solely relied upon for real-world mushroom consumption decisions.
