# Mushroom Classification Using AdaBoost

##  Business Problem
Mushroom poisoning is a serious public health risk, as some poisonous mushrooms closely resemble edible ones.
The objective of this project is to **develop a predictive machine learning model** that can identify whether a mushroom is **edible or poisonous** based on its physical characteristics.

Additionally, the project aims to derive **general guidelines** that people should consider when picking mushrooms, based on important features influencing the prediction.

---

##  Business Objective
- Accurately classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous**
- Reduce the risk of accidental mushroom poisoning
- Support safer decision-making using data-driven insights
- Highlight key features that indicate poisonous mushrooms

---

##  Problem Type
- **Classification Problem**
- **Binary Outcome:** Edible / Poisonous

---

##  Solution Approach
1. Data understanding and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding and transformation
3. Model training using **AdaBoost Classifier**
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
5. Interpretation of important features
6. Translating insights into **human-readable safety guidelines**

---

##  Key Features Considered
- Cap shape and color
- Gill size and color
- Odor
- Spore print color
- Ring type
- Habitat

These features play a critical role in determining mushroom safety.

---

##  Business Impact
- Helps prevent health hazards caused by poisonous mushrooms
- Acts as a **decision-support tool**, not a replacement for expert knowledge
- Encourages awareness of high-risk mushroom traits

---

## Project File
- **AdaBoost (ML).ipynb** – Contains data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights


##  Important Disclaimer
This project is intended for **educational and awareness purposes only**.
It should **not be solely relied upon** for real-world mushroom consumption decisions.
